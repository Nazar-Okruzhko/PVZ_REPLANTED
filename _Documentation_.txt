I've also put most of the assets into the Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted wiki fandom gallery, I've put there sounds too, as well as some trivia descriptions.
Two different people also contributed and put Level Backgrounds and dynamic music instrument to the wiki, now you don't even have to download all those files hovewer I highly recommend you to do so.
